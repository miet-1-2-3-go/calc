## Vector Spaces

A vector space ($V$), sometimes called a **linear space**, is a collection of elements that can be added together and multiplied by scalars [1, 2].

| Concept | Key Definition/Rule | Citation(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Elements (Members)** | Elements of $V$ can be vectors, matrices, or even functions (like linear polynomials) [1, 3, 4]. They must have properties like associative and commutative addition, and they must include a zero vector and an additive inverse [5]. | [3–5] |
| **Notation** | **V** denotes the vector space [1]. **R** denotes the set of all real numbers [6]. **Rⁿ** (written as $\mathbb{R}^n$) is the set of real vectors with length $n$ [7]. | [1, 6, 7] |
| **The Crucial Test: CLOSURE** | Closure is the important property that **determines if $V$ is a vector space** [8]. Both rules below must be satisfied for a set to be closed [9, 10]. | [8–10] |
| **Closure Rule 1 (Scalar Multiplication)** | Multiplying an element of $V$ by **any scalar** must yield a result that is **also within $V$** [8]. | [8] |
| **Closure Rule 2 (Addition)** | **Adding any two elements** ($a$ and $b$) within $V$ must yield a result that is **also contained within $V$** [8]. | [8] |
| **Example Spaces** | The set of **real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)** is a vector space [7]. The set of **$\mathbb{R}^n$ vectors** (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^3$) is a vector space [3, 7]. The set of **linear polynomials** ($ax + b$) is a vector space [4, 10]. | [3, 4, 7, 10] |
| **Example Failure** | A set fails to be a vector space if adding two elements produces a result **outside** the original set (e.g., adding two vectors where the second row is 2 results in 4, which is not in the original set) [10, 11]. | [10, 11] |

## Test Me!

Please answer the following questions based on the sources:

1. What is the alternate name for a vector space?  
2. What crucial property determines if a set $V$ is considered a vector space?  
3. Name one of the two requirements for this crucial property to be satisfied.  
4. If you add two elements of a vector space, where must the resulting sum be found?  
5. If a set of vectors is defined such that the second row must always have the value 2, why does this set fail the vector space criteria when adding two elements together?
